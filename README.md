### How to compile and execute it?
[TODO]

- v1.0.0 - working version
- v2.0.0 - adding interruptions (watermark)
- v2.0.1 - adding concurrence treatment (mutexes and spinlocks)
- v3.0.0 - no IOCTL, reading three axis (a whole fifo element) per call

## How to Contribute to the Project
- Any implementation that could lead to a more optimised code for the different methods already designed would be a nice improvement for this project. 

So feel free to fork, change, and pull request ðŸ˜Š
